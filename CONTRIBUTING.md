PEPS needs contributors, so thanks for considering contributing.

# Repositories and CLA

Note that there are two repositories: This one with the distribution definition and configuration (Docker containers) and [the application source](https://github.com/MLstate/PEPS-source). The reason is that you don't need to clone the source when deploying servers.

To get started, <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/MLstate/PEPS">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>. The CLA is directly adapted from the Apache Foundation CLA and does *not* require you to assign copyright of your contributions.

Then, fork the repository and submit pull requests. They will be reviewed before merging.
